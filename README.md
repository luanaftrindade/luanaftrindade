welcome to my coding adventure! 👩‍💻✨

## about me
After two years of mastering the art of IT recruitment, I've decided to dive headfirst into the enchanting world of coding! 🧙‍♂️🌝 
Currently, I'm on a thrilling journey in a full-stack bootcamp, honing my skills in software development. My goal is to secure a brand new job in the development world, where I can unleash my creativity and tackle challenges that push me to think outside the box. 🧠

## what I'm up to
🎥 When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me grooving to the beats of my favorite music or getting lost in a captivating movie. 🎬
🌍 Apart from my career aspirations, I volunteer as a Harm Reduction Technician at APDES, an organization dedicated to promoting social inclusion through cross-community projects.
