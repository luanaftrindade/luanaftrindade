welcome to my coding adventure! 👩‍💻✨

## about me
After two years of mastering the challenges of IT recruitment, I've decided to dive headfirst into the enchanting world of coding! 🧙‍♂️🌝 
Currently, I'm on a thrilling journey in a full-stack bootcamp, honing my skills in software development. My goal is to land a brand new job in development, where I can let my creativity run wild and embrace challenges that make me think outside the box.🧠
 When I'm not busy crafting code, you'll find me grooving to the beats of my favorite music or lost in some movie. 🎬
